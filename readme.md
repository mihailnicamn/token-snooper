parse relevant statistics : 
- number of new addreses on timeseries (each spike without catalyst (airdrop/release/anything) may show fake addreses)
- number of in-and-out addresses on timeseries (each spike without catalyst may show wash trading done with burner addresses)
- number of transactions on timeseries (relative activity of token)
- if easy solution ðŸ˜…, https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree tree structure view with the ability to replay the transactions (to get common sens about the tokens general activity)


working at the moment :
- load all token transactions from blockchain using web3.js (any compatible evm blockchain) little slow including the query limit of 3000-5000 depending on the blockchain customizable within config.json, it stops on first block that has transaction from coinbase (null adress/zero address, common the deployment block) with the delay from config.json
- generate html report with transactions and addresses


``` npm start load <token_address> ```

``` npm start load 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7 ``` # usdt on ethereum (if you got spare time ðŸ˜…)
